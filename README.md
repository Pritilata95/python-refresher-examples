# Python Examples

This repository contains simple examples to help you quickly learn and review Python concepts. It may help to brush up on your Python skills or see how common tasks are done.

### Notes regarding Environment
The examples are intentionally kept simple. Any base Python environment from Conda should suffice for most of them. If new packages are needed to realise any example, it will be mentioned in the corresponding example README. I am using Python 3.9 as base Python. You can download Conda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
